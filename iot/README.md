Experiments for integrating IoT devices into the mesh.

First priority is Wifi-enabled devices, which can act as mesh AP and gateways to other protocols.
 
In particular LoRa and ESP32 are a cheap and easy to use option. 

# Protocols

There are few estabilished protocols for message encryption - the assumption is that IoT devices might
use Webpush or the 'native' schema for end to end encryption and addressing.  Webpush is ideal as a common
ground, but the overhead is still too large for low power devices.

Relevant standards:

- LoRa WAN

- BLE Mesh 

- Thread

# Addressing
